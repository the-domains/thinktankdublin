Idea \#1

DAZ3D, Maya, Autodesk and Iray products need a lot of gpu processing power to work; not easily implemented for hobbists wanting to render a complex project.  nVidea cards needed for this to have a quick render possible cost 800 euro upward. The only gaming gpu possible of instant rendering is the TitanX video card starting 1000 euros. 

To solve this steep investment issue a render farm can be set up for people to use; sending your project of off site rendering; render in the cloud; iray / nvidea servers are now in beta stage. Making it a possibility for investors to fill that gap.

Needed; 2u server; 2 nvidea workstation video cards, user interface and nvidea render farm software (now in beta stage); co-locate your server in for instance lease web for 70 euros a month; people can then use the processor time by the hour. Rates seen on similar sites starting at 3.5o euros per hour.
